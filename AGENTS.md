# PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES ⚡

## Step 1.1: Fix DSL Operation Parameter Generation

**ISSUE**: DSL operations missing required arguments, causing 100% program execution failures

**FILES TO MODIFY**:
- `arc_solver/search.py` (lines ~30-50)
- `arc_solver/enhanced_search.py` (parameter generation sections)

**SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED**:

1. **Fix crop operation parameters**:
```python
# BROKEN (current):
"crop": [{}]

# FIX TO:
"crop": [{"top": t, "left": l, "height": h, "width": w} 
         for t in range(0, 3) for l in range(0, 3) 
         for h in range(1, 4) for w in range(1, 4)]
```

2. **Fix pad operation parameters**:
```python
# BROKEN (current):
"pad": [{}]

# FIX TO:
"pad": [{"out_h": h, "out_w": w} 
        for h in range(5, 20) for w in range(5, 20)]
```

3. **Fix recolor operation parameters**:
```python
# BROKEN (current):
"recolor": [{}]

# FIX TO:
"recolor": [{"mapping": {i: j}} 
           for i in range(10) for j in range(10) if i != j]
```

**VALIDATION**: Run evaluation script - should see actual program attempts instead of parameter errors

**PROGRESS MARKER**: 
```
[X] Step 1.1 COMPLETED - DSL parameters fixed, no more "missing required arguments" errors
    Date: 2025-09-11
    Test Result: 0% success on 1 eval task (no parameter errors)
    Notes: Parameter enumeration for crop/pad/recolor verified; unit tests pass
```

---

## Step 1.2: Fix Solver Result Collection

**ISSUE**: `solve_task()` claims success but returns empty test results

**FILES TO MODIFY**:
- `arc_solver/solver.py` (around lines 45-70)

**SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED**:

1. **Debug result dictionary structure**:
```python
# In solve_task method, ensure proper result collection:
def solve_task(self, task: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, List[List[int]]]]]) -> Dict[str, List[List[List[int]]]]:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # ENSURE this section properly collects results:
    test_predictions = []
    for test_input in test_inputs:
        # Get predictions from enhanced or baseline search
        predictions = self._get_predictions(train_pairs, test_input)
        if predictions:
            test_predictions.append(predictions[0])  # Take first prediction
        else:
            test_predictions.append([])  # Empty fallback
    
    return {"test": test_predictions}
```

2. **Fix prediction collection logic**:
- Ensure `_get_predictions` method actually returns predictions
- Add debug logging to trace where predictions are lost
- Verify test input processing pipeline

**VALIDATION**: Solver should return non-empty test results for at least some tasks

**PROGRESS MARKER**: 
```
[X] Step 1.2 COMPLETED - Solver returns actual predictions instead of empty results
    Date: 2025-09-11
    Test Result: produced non-empty outputs on sample rotation task; schema tests pass
    Notes: Added per-input prediction collection with baseline fallback
```

---

## Step 1.3: Fix Array Comparison Errors

**ISSUE**: Numpy array comparison failures in baseline solver

**FILES TO MODIFY**:
- `arc_solver/search.py` (array equality checks)
- `arc_solver/grid.py` (eq function)

**SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED**:

1. **Fix array equality comparisons**:
```python
# In search.py, replace problematic comparisons:
# BROKEN:
if predicted == expected:

# FIX TO:
if isinstance(predicted, np.ndarray) and isinstance(expected, np.ndarray):
    if predicted.shape == expected.shape and np.array_equal(predicted, expected):
        # Match found
elif predicted == expected:
    # Non-array comparison
```

2. **Fix broadcasting errors**:
- Add shape validation before array operations
- Handle mismatched dimensions gracefully
- Add proper error handling for malformed grids

**VALIDATION**: Baseline solver should run without numpy errors

**PROGRESS MARKER**: 
```
[X] Step 1.3 COMPLETED - No more array comparison or broadcasting errors
    Date: 2025-02-14
    Test Result: pytest 98 passed
    Notes: Added robust array equality and duplicate attempt fallback
```

## Step 1.4: Validate Phase 1 Completion

**GOAL**: Confirm all critical bugs are fixed

**VALIDATION SCRIPT**:
```python
# Run this test to confirm Phase 1 completion:
python3 -c "
from arc_solver.solver import ARCSolver
import json

# Load test data
with open('data/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json', 'r') as f:
    challenges = json.load(f)

solver = ARCSolver()
task_id = list(challenges.keys())[0]
result = solver.solve_task(challenges[task_id])

print(f'Task {task_id}:')
print(f'  Results returned: {len(result.get(\"test\", []))}')
print(f'  Non-empty results: {sum(1 for r in result.get(\"test\", []) if r)}')
print('Phase 1 SUCCESS if no errors above and non-empty results > 0')
"
```

**PROGRESS MARKER**: 
```
[ ] PHASE 1 COMPLETED - Critical bugs fixed, solver produces actual attempts
    Date: ___________
    Final Test Result: ___% accuracy (target: > 0%)
    Ready for Phase 2: [ ] YES / [ ] NO

        return sorted(hypotheses, key=lambda h: h.confidence, reverse=True)
    
    def test_hypothesis(self, hypothesis: Hypothesis, train_pairs: List[Tuple[Array, Array]]) -> float:
        """Test hypothesis validity against training data."""
        # Implement hypothesis testing logic
        pass
    
    def refine_hypothesis(self, hypothesis: Hypothesis, feedback: Dict) -> Hypothesis:
        """Refine hypothesis based on test results."""

        """Find tasks with similar abstract structure, not just surface features."""
        # Implement structural similarity matching
        pass
        
    def map_solution_structure(self, source_solution: Program, target_task: Task) -> Program:
        """Map solution from analogous task to current task."""

# 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENT

## Mandatory Process:
1. **Work on ONE STEP at a time** - Do not skip ahead
2. **Complete each step fully** before moving to the next
3. **Fill in EVERY progress marker** when you complete a step
4. **Test your implementation** after each step
5. **Document any issues** in the Notes section

## After Each Step:
```
ALWAYS add your progress marker like this:

[X] Step X.X COMPLETED - [Brief description of what was implemented]
    Date: 2024-MM-DD
    Test Result: [Specific test results or accuracy improvement]
    Notes: [Any issues, observations, or important details]
```

## Before Starting Phase 2, 3, or 4:
- **Verify ALL previous steps are marked complete**
- **Confirm test results meet the phase targets**
- **Do not proceed if previous phase is incomplete**

## Emergency Procedures:
- If a step fails or causes regressions, **STOP** and fix before proceeding
- If test accuracy decreases, **investigate and resolve** before continuing
- If you encounter issues beyond the scope of these instructions, **document thoroughly** and request guidance
